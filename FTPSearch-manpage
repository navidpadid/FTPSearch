.\" my man page code is:

.TH man page  "07 Jan 2019" "man (page)" "FTPSearch"
.SH NAME
OS project \- FTP search engine
.SH DESCRIPTION

Welcome to FTPSearch!
 
Simple search engine with REGEX support

Well according to RFC959 FTP does not support search meaning you
have to find your desired files all by yourself.
As a computer programmer this is awful for us, so we have decided
to implement a simple bash script program that is simply FTP
client with search!

FTPSearch = FTP IN TERMINAL + SEARCH SUPPORT

There are ways that you can go on to be able to search in FTP as a file, therefore you must first make a shadow of FTP in your linux native filesystem. I will use curlftpfs inorder to mount the FTP in my /mnt/FTPSearch .

.SH OPTIONS
You can have cd, ls, exit, and search and clearup command in this code.
You can know more about all these commands with help command.
.SH TODO
Add auto completion
